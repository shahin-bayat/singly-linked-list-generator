# Linked Lists

Liked list a data structure which is not built in JavaScript. In this mini project I have implemented a TypeScript class to generate the single linked list.

> a singly linked list contains a set of nodes. Each node has two elements,

    1. value
    2. pointer to next node

The first node is called the **head** and the last node is called the **tail**.

## How to run?

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## Time Complexity

| operaion | Big O |
| -------- | ----- |
| prepend  | O(1)  |
| append   | O(1)  |
| lookup   | O(n)  |
| delete   | O(n)  |
| insert   | O(n)  |

## Motivation

I have seen wrong implementations of _append_ on the web. The way I have implemented fits exactly with time complexity table. Please let me know if you are interested in implementing more data structures in JS/TS.
